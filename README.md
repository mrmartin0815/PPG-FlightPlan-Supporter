# PPG-FlightPlan-Supporter
This is a supporttool for (PPG) flight planning and a map representation, that shows built-up/inhabited and forested areas along a direct line between two points (geocoordinates). This representation can help find a flight path (e.g., for paramotor pilots) that does not pass over these areas. Dark brown: residential area, camp_site and cemetry. Light brown: industrial, commercial, retail, military and farmyard area. Cyan: orchards and vineyards Green: wood/forest area. Red: Towers, wind-turbines. Purple: runways.
Additionally you can export the waypoints into gpx-files or into the format needed by XCTrack.
