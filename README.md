# PPG-FlightPlanner
This is a map representation that shows built-up/inhabited and forested areas along a direct line between two points (geocoordinates). This representation can help find a flight path (e.g., for paramotor pilots) that does not pass over these areas. Dark brown: residential area, camp_site and cemetry. Light brown: industrial, commercial, retail, military and farmyard area. Gren: wood, forest area. Red: Towers, wind-turbines. Purple: runway.
